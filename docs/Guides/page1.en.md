# Custom entity datapack


Epic Fight isn't normally compatible with other mods, especially with the entities. So you have to manually define the entity's model, animations, and other attribute values. This can be achieved by using Datapack.
***

## **üí° Making the pack.mcmeta file**

First, you'll need to create a pack.mcmeta by making a normal txt file and renaming it to pack.mcmeta (make sure filename extensions are turned on).

After that edit it and add these lines of code for your datapack to work.
```JSON
{
	"pack":{
		"pack_format":15,
		"description":"A short description on your pack"
		}
}
```

### **üìÑ pack_format Values**

<center>

| Version | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1.16.2‚Äì1.16.5 | 6 |
| 1.17.x | 7 |
| 1.18.2 | 8 |
| 1.19.2 | 9 |
| 1.20.1 | 15 |

</center>

## **üí° Creating a JSON file & Folder path -**


Before you create a JSON file, you should get the registry name of the entity you want to make compatible. In Minecraft, you can see the list of entities registered now by "/summon" command.

</center>

Most of the registry names consist of "modid:entityname". If you get the registry name, you can create the JSON file under the following path -
<center>
`data/"modid"/epicfight_mobpatch/"entityname".json`
</center>
***

## **üí° Obtaining armature, animation and model tags -**

[Model files](https://github.com/Yesssssman/epicfightmod/blob/1.18.2/src/main/java/yesman/epicfight/api/client/model/Meshes.java)

[Armature Files](https://github.com/Yesssssman/epicfightmod/blob/1.18.2/src/main/java/yesman/epicfight/gameasset/Armatures.java)

[Animation files](https://github.com/Yesssssman/epicfightmod/blob/1.18.2/src/main/java/yesman/epicfight/gameasset/Animations.java)
***
## **üí° Easy Setup -**

### **üìò Using presets**


For entities that extend the vanilla classes/or simmilar models to the ones in vanilla you can use presets as a simple setup method.
```JSON
{
	"preset": "minecraft:creeper"
}
```

You should know that this will not work properly if the targeted entity doesn't share its code with the vanilla entity (if the entity class doesn't extend the vanilla class), although it is seemingly the same. The allowed values are all the entity's registry names that are registered in the [code](https://github.com/Yesssssman/epicfightmod/blob/1.18.2/src/main/java/yesman/epicfight/world/capabilities/provider/EntityPatchProvider.java)

### **‚ùå Disabling an "epicfied" entity**


You also can disable entity animations and custom models by using the following line (inside of entityname.json):
```JSON
{
	"disabled": true
}
```

***
## **üí° Entity animation features -**
In epic fight you are able to change entity ai's and behaviour through datapacks. You can customize which animations should be played according to certain behaviors.

Below is a simple example of how you can create a punching zombie.
```JSON
{
	"model": "epicfight:entity/biped_old_texture",
	"armature": "epicfight:entity/biped",
	"renderer": "minecraft:zombie",
	"isHumanoid": false,

	},
	"stun_animations": {

	},
	"combat_behavior": [
		{

				}
			]
		}
	]
}
```

## **üí° Changing the animation based on the weapon its holding -**
For the humanoid mobs, you can set different animation sets depending on the weapon they're holding. In this case, the format of the "combat_behaviors" is slightly changed. First, you have to check if you set the "isHumanoid" value to true.

Below is an example of how you can create a zombie, that wields a sword like a wither skeleton while idle and walking, attacking with a sword, or punching with empty hands.
```JSON
